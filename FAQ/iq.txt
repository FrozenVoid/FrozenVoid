I'm often asked things like 'whats your IQ', so lets explore that:
I've took several IQ tests and results are about range of 125-138(the upper portion of range seems to occur when dedicating more time per question).
 IQ tests are not measuring general intelligence, only a subset dealing with pattern
 recognition and logical inference capability: the idea is that it correlates in
 general intelligence, but intelligence can be narrow/specialized(thats why IQ tests
can be trained for).
IQ tests(esp. Raven's progressive matrices) also seem to favor a specific abstract thinking pattern where
'choice ranking'(ranking of available choices by their compatibility with pattern, like a neural network picking a path) dominates, which limits imagination and lowers difficulty substantially(the choice rating problem is not pure pattern recognition, when most of choices are weeded out and only difficulty is choosing which pattern is most compatible with series);
a more fluid intelligence test would present an interface for drawing/creating the next pattern element, instead of choosing a pattern in pre-determined list(rigid vs fluid test approach).
